# Ingredient Normalisation, Consolidation & Variant-Level Price Book
**Date:** 2026-06-25 (session spanned 2026-06-06 → 2026-06-25)
**Project:** Daily Shuffle — recipe/meal-planning PWA
**Mode:** Rolling Log + GitHub Push
**Status:** In Progress — Phase 1 (naming/normalisation) complete; Phase 2 (apply to app) pending

---

## Project Context
Daily Shuffle is a single-file PWA (`index.html` ~250 KB + `legacy/` stashed modules) for shuffling
recipes into meal plans with a grocery list and a cost/price book. Recipes live in Supabase
(`recipes.ingredient_sections`, free-text). The price book lives in browser `localStorage`
(`ds_pricebook`) and syncs to Supabase `user_library`. Goal of this work stream: turn the messy,
free-text recipe ingredients into a clean normalised vocabulary so each ingredient can be priced once
and recipe/plan/grocery costs compute automatically. First entry in this log — full roadmap also lives
in `HANDOFF.md` at repo root (the living roadmap; this log is the session record).

## Session Goal
Scope missing ingredient prices → normalise the recipe ingredient wording → consolidate
like/comparable variants → produce a variant-level price book the user can fill in → set up the
machinery (CSVs + in-app importers) to apply it all later.

## State Before This Session
Nothing existed for this stream. Price book was a 38-row seed in `index.html`. Recipe ingredients were
raw free-text with no normalisation, no consolidation, no per-ingredient pricing. No roadmap doc.

## What Was Done
A long, iterative build, roughly in order:
1. **Scoped** the architecture: recipes in Supabase (project `jsxcctrskkkxgdxfaduo`), 305 ready recipes /
   3,915 ingredient lines (3,485 real, **430 null** across 36 recipes). Found the engine fns
   (`canonicalise`, `parseQty`, `_toBase`, `classifyAisle`, `lookupPriceBook`, `savePriceBook`,
   `computeRecipeCost`, `_groceryAggregate`) and the unused `priceBook[].aliases` hook.
2. **Missing-prices sheet** (615 unpriced ingredients) → **recipe normalisation worksheet** (3,915 lines
   parsed to qty/unit/ingredient/note).
3. Built **two in-app importers** in `index.html` (committed, NOT deployed): "Import ingredient CSV"
   (`importRecipeIngredientsCsv`) and "Import price CSV" (`importPriceBookCsv`).
4. **Consolidation**: built a rules-engine clusterer; iterated through several rounds of the user's
   specific decisions to merge/keep-distinct comparable variants; produced a reviewable
   consolidation worksheet and a comprehensive **category → product → variant** master list.
5. **Re-modelled** after the user edited the master: confirmed the tier semantics (see Decisions), split
   the "compound" problem into true ingredient-splits vs prep/medium-to-note, produced a reconciled
   **split-plan** (28 splits), applied splits + pepper normalisation.
6. **Full master-driven regeneration** (`tools-apply-master.mjs`): the user's curated master became the
   single source of truth; generated the final recipe worksheet (names from master) + variant-level
   price book.
7. **Fixed a matcher gap** the user flagged: exact-canon matching only covered 92% of lines; switched to
   `canon(cleanRaw(name))` + UK/US spelling normalise (yoghurt↔yogurt) → **99%**. Exported the residual
   32 wordings for fold-in.
8. **Tidied** the repo to a self-contained pipeline; **promoted the edited master into the repo**;
   wrote/realigned `HANDOFF.md` as the project roadmap (none existed); saved this session log.

Things tried and corrected: initially had **product/variant roles backwards** (assumed product = price
unit) — the user's edits proved variant = price unit, product = family; re-modelled accordingly.
Initially conflated ingredient-splits with prep/medium separation — the user caught it; separated them.

## Decisions & Reasoning
- **Data model — variant = price unit + recipe name; product = family/grouping only; category = aisle.**
  Confirmed from the user's master edits (almond/soya/dairy milk all → product "Milk" but priced
  separately as variants). Product is organisation, *not* a shared price. (I had it backwards first;
  the edits corrected me.)
- **Apply to both price book + recipes, moderate grouping, reviewable-CSV-first.** Chosen via
  AskUserQuestion. Non-destructive: the master keeps the original `variant` and adds `*_change`
  columns, so the mapping is auditable/re-runnable and traceable back to recipes.
- **Aliases attach to the variant, not the product**, and **recipes are rewritten to the variant**, so
  the grocery list groups naturally without code; `product` is carried into the app only to *group*
  the grocery list within an aisle. Leverages the pre-existing-but-unused `priceBook[].aliases`.
- **Splits happen at recipe-line grain (qty is per occurrence); name changes are 1→1 via the master;
  prep/medium descriptors (in brine, drained, to taste) move to the note — NOT a split.** The user
  flagged that splitting-ingredients vs separating-prep are different operations; kept them separate.
- **Specific consolidation rules** (locked): `A or B`→first+note · only `white sugar`→Sugar · flavoured
  yoghurts distinct · bare defaults (onion→Yellow Onion, flour→Plain Flour, butter→Butter,
  cabbage→White Cabbage, oil→Vegetable Oil, yog(h)urt→Plain Yoghurt) · citrus juice/zest/whole→fruit ·
  light olive oil→Olive Oil · light/dark soy & Light Sour Cream distinct · white pepper distinct ·
  cracked/ground/black→Black Pepper · UK spellings · `dairy free milk` intentional · nut butters ≠
  Butter · named oils ≠ Vegetable Oil · jasmine/basmati rice protected.
- **Matcher: `canon(cleanRaw(name))` + yoghurt↔yogurt normalise, not exact canon.** Exact-canon left
  qty/measure cruft ("juice of 1 lime", "sheets rice paper", "½ cups bean sprouts") and the UK/US
  yoghurt spelling unmatched → only 92%. The cleaned key (same cleaning the master keys were built
  with) → 99%, and dropped price variants 987→811.
- **Master promoted into the repo + superseded files removed.** Makes the pipeline self-contained and
  not dependent on the ephemeral upload path; reduces confusion. History preserves the removed tools.
- **HANDOFF.md is the roadmap** because no project-wide phasing doc existed; `legacy/README.md` is a
  separate parallel track (stashed Track/Pantry/Wellness modules to re-graft later).

## Current State (end of session)
Phase 1 done: recipe ingredient names normalised in `recipe-ingredient-normalisation.final.csv`
(~99% mapped to the master; **computed in the CSV, NOT yet written to live recipes**), 28 splits
applied, variant-level `pricebook.csv` scaffolded (empty prices), residual 32 in
`unmatched-ingredients.csv`. Importers exist on the branch but the branch is **not deployed**. Nothing
has been written to the live Supabase recipes or the live price book yet.

## Next Steps
1. **User fills `pricebook.csv`** top-down (usage-sorted; first ~100 cover most recipes); tidy rough
   Product labels (e.g. `Maple Syrup → "Syrup"`).
2. Optionally **fold `unmatched-ingredients.csv` (32 rows)** into `ingredient-master.csv`, then re-run
   `node tools-apply-master.mjs`.
3. **Phase 2 — apply to the app** (next session): (a) extend `importPriceBookCsv` to read **Aliases** +
   **Product** columns and allow alias-only rows; (b) add a `product` field to price entries and group
   the grocery list **by product within aisle**; (c) tighten the greedy `lookupPriceBook` substring
   fallback (egg↔eggplant) now aliases exist; (d) **PR to deploy** the branch; (e) import
   `recipe-ingredient-normalisation.final.csv` + filled `pricebook.csv`; (f) handle the `-2/-3` split
   row_key ordering in the importer.
4. **Re-enter the 430 null lines** (36 recipes) from source.
5. **Phase 3 — auto-pricing** (Supabase Edge Function or local scraper, keyed on the variant vocab;
   manual-override flag). **Phase 4 — cost features** (recipe/plan cost surfacing, shop-by-product
   grocery, per-100g, budget-aware planning, price history, store comparison) — see HANDOFF.md §5.

## Open Questions / Blockers
- Orange juice: rolled into `Orange` (fruit) — fine if squeezed, wrong if a carton; user to confirm.
- `Garlic Clove` vs `Garlic` still separate variants — merge by setting `variant change = Garlic`?
- Where the "dairy-free sub OK" style notes should surface (recipe note vs price-book note).
- Not blocking: waiting on the user to fill prices to validate the whole model end-to-end.

## Environment & Config Notes
- Repo: `saffronlm-cmyk/daily-shuffle`, branch `claude/recipe-ingredient-prices-RYSob` (work NOT on
  `main`; not deployed). Cloud/remote Claude Code env with a **network allowlist** (direct Supabase
  REST was blocked; used the Supabase MCP instead).
- Supabase project `jsxcctrskkkxgdxfaduo` ("saffronlilith's Project"). Tables: `recipes`
  (`ingredient_sections` JSONB, `import_status='ready'`), `user_library` (row `id='default'`, holds the
  synced price book blob; `priceBook` field currently empty).
- App secrets already in `index.html`: `RECIPE_LIB_URL` + anon key (`RECIPE_LIB_KEY`). localStorage keys:
  `ds_pricebook`, `ds_recipe_cache`, `ds_overrides`, `ds_custom_recipes`.
- Pipeline: `node tools-apply-master.mjs` reads `ingredient-master.csv` + `split-plan.csv` +
  `recipe-ingredient-normalisation.csv` → writes the two output CSVs. Node 22; scripts are ESM `.mjs`.
- In-app importer entry points (index.html): `importRecipeIngredientsCsv`, `importPriceBookCsv`,
  `patchRecipeToLibrary` (pushes recipe edits to cloud), `lookupPriceBook` (~line 2750),
  `savePriceBook` (~2558).

## Notes & Gotchas
- **Recipe ingredients store medium/prep inline** ("tuna in brine", "1 large carrot, diced") — the
  parser moves these to the note; don't treat them as splits.
- **UK vs US spelling**: master uses "yoghurt"; recipes mix "yogurt" — the matcher normalises
  yoghurt↔yogurt. Any new matching logic must keep this.
- **430 null recipe lines** have no text at all (lost on import) — they can't be normalised, only
  re-entered from the original recipes.
- **Split rows use `row_key` suffixes `-2/-3`** — the importer currently sorts by numeric section/line;
  it must be taught to order these (Phase 2).
- **`.numbers` files can't be parsed** here (Apple proprietary) — always ask for CSV export.
- The `present_files`/file-delivery to the user worked throughout via the file-send tool; CSVs were the
  exchange format.
